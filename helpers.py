Our dictionary to hold which genres we are giving to our users. Play around with
this dictionary to see how the starter code changes on index.html. The keys
represent the names as they appear on the website, and the values represent the
chart IDs for Billboard to use.

TODO: Add at least two more genres to this dictionary. Information on how to find
      more Billboard chart IDs is on the Billboard library documentation, as
      linked on the core page of the spec. Make sure you only choose charts that
      contain SONGS (not artists, albums, etc.).
